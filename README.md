# Bug Tracker Lite (Full-stack starter)
A lightweight bug tracker with a minimal Express API and a vanilla JS frontend.
## What is included
- backend/: Express API with CRUD endpoints for issues
- frontend/: static HTML that talks to the API
- basic Jest + Supertest example test
## How to use
1. Start backend: cd backend && npm install && npm run dev
2. Open frontend/index.html in your browser (or serve with a static server)
## QA notes
- Add API tests in backend/tests, use Supertest and Jest.
- Add end-to-end tests with Cypress (suggested)
